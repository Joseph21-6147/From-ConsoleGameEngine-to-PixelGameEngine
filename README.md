# From-ConsoleGameEngine-to-PixelGameEngine
Contains code from most of JavidX9's ConsoleGameEngine video's that is ported to olcPixelGameEngine

Being a fan of JavidX9 I implemented most of his video's. In 2017 he developed the olcConsoleGameEngine (CGE for short) as a console based platform for game, concept and algorithm developement. In 2018 the olcPixelGameEngine (PGE) v. 1.0 was introduced, and the accent shifted to development on the PGE. 

Recently the CGE has been deprecated and is no longer supported. It is still possible to follow the CGE based video's and doing the implementation on the old CGE platform, but you can also do the implementation on the newer, much more feature rich, cross platform and supported PGE. 

I implemented all these CGE video's on the CGE platform, and ported most of them to the newer PGE platform. To help anyone who wants to follow these CGE based video's I decided to upload all these ports. I also put a cheat sheet that describes how to port from CGE to PGE yourself if you want.

The original code is there as well, but I took the liberty to outcomment the "using namespace std;" lines and correct with scope resolution operators were necessary. You can recognize the CGE in the name. The file having the PGE in the name is the ported code. I put them toghether to enable easy comparison of both versions.

I'm having no licence or copyright on this code whatsoever - the original GNU GPLv3 licence applies and is there in each of the code files. 

In the header comment I added a little summary of adaptations I did. 

Have fun with it!
